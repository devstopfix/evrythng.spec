# Specifications

## Identifiers

Thngs are identified by a globally unique 24 character number. The number is not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[Base64] encoded - only 48 characters are used and ambiguous characters are dropped. This gives 48^24^ combinations (22 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers[Duodecillion]) or approximately 10^40^ identifiers (see https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=48%5E24+%3D+10%5Ex[WolframAlpha]).

The identifiers tend to have +U+ as a prefix.
